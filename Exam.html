                One of the most common options after doing M.Tech. is to pursue a Ph.D, but this an individual’s choice. Students also need to have clarity in their choice that they want to work as a professor or go for research work. The Government of India has granted research and development organizations and Central Universities like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology (NITs) to promote higher education in India. Eventually, after M.Tech. students decide the area on which they will pursue their Ph.D., this area of specialization is based on their selected stream in M.Tech. Although, the institute is the final authority and it will decide the area of research. This is based on the aptitude of the student.
            </p>
                The interdisciplinary approach in Ph.D. is gaining immense popularity. Students need to apply for the National Eligibility Test (NET) supervised by UGC. University Grants Commission (UGC), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) offer scholarships to Ph.D. students.
  
                In this course, research and projects are vital parts rather than examinations and assignments. Similar to the courses, there are various career options in the industry. Graduates can opt for opportunities based on their specialization after completing their course. Students majorly opt for Ph.D. and research fields, after completing their M.Tech. degree. Though there are also many career options, like students may join a company or teaching profession or may become an entrepreneur.

                Careers Opportunities after M. Tech
                When the question of ‘What after M.Tech’ arises, there are several options for students who have completed their M. Tech programme. There are primarily three areas where students can make full use of their expertise. When it comes to careers, M.Tech students can work as civil engineers, software engineers, electronics and telecommunication engineers and electrical and electronics engineers among many other engineering professions.

                Master of Technology helps engineers to get the ability to implement the latest trends and technologies to solve problems. Bachelor of Engineering is a four-year-long course which comprises eight semesters. M.Tech. can be full time and as well as a part-time course, after completing graduation, students can join this course. Students can get enrolled in this programme by qualifying various entrance exams conducted by universities at the state and national levels.
